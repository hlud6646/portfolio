{% block words %}
	I got a bad mark in second year ODE's class when we were asked to make static plots of 2D systems
	in mathematica. I handed in something like this thinking it was a sin not to make a moving image when 
	you have the opportunity to.  Surely you get a better feeling about how the system behaves from a 
	tool like this than a plain image with lines and arrows on it.  This is obviously not perfect, 
	just a sketch of something to fill out another time.
